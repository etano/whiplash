Reduces the complexity of a cluster to the complexity of your laptop.

Bringing the complexity of a cluster down to the complexity of your laptop.

Bring the simplicity of your laptop to a cluster.

Scale from your laptop to a cluster without changing anything.

Scale from your laptop to a cluster without adjustment.

Run simulations on a cluster as if running on your laptop.

Reducing complexity.

Laptop = cluster.

A cluster in your lap.

__Fast__.

The core of [Whiplash](http://whiplash.ethz.ch) is written entirely in high-performance, templated C++. This allows scaling to billions of simulations with minimal overhead.

__Flexible__.

To facilitate easy of use for a variety of possible applications, [Whiplash](http://whiplash.ethz.ch) is built around a schemaless NoSQL database. This allows users to store arbitrary information with each simulation.

__Simple__.

[Whiplash](http://whiplash.ethz.ch) comes packaged with a slim, convenient interface, implemented as a Python module. Deployment is just as easy using the [Docker](http://docker.com) container system.

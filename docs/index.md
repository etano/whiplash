# WhiplashDB

---

An extremely flexible, high throughput simulation framework built by researchers for researchers.

---

__Fast__.

The core of [WhiplashDB](http://whiplash.ethz.ch) is written entirely in high-performance, templated C++. This allows scaling to billions of simulations with minimal overhead.

__Flexible__.

To facilitate easy of use for a variety of possible applications, [WhiplashDB](http://whiplash.ethz.ch) is built around a schemaless NoSQL database. This allows users to store arbitrary information with each simulation.

__Simple__.

[WhiplashDB](http://whiplash.ethz.ch) comes packaged with a slim, convenient interface, implemented as a Python module. Deployment is just as easy using the [Docker](http://docker.com) container system.

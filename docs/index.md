WhiplashDB
==========

WhiplashDB is a framework to run large numbers of simulations in a
distributed environment. It aims to maximise efficiency, convenience
and reproducibility by storing inputs and outputs of each simulation
in a database, handling direct interaction with clusters and queing of
jobs, and providing a convenient interface to submit jobs and analyse
output.

The framework is based on the MongoDB NoSQL database and includes a
library of problem classes as well as job scheduling and statistical
analysis interfaces. WhiplashDB is an executable database, meaning
results to queries can be computed on the fly (see the
[Querying](#querying) section for more information).

Each job is composed of three components: a model, an executable and a
property

* model: a problem instance which serves as an input to an
  executeble.

* property: job description passed on to the executable, including
  input parameters, specification of the model, etc. When a job
  succesfully finishes, it appends its output to the property with
  which it was called.

* executable: the binary executed by the job.

## Setup

### Installation

Currently installation is as simple as

    git clone git@gitlab.phys.ethz.ch:zintchenko/whiplashdb.git
    cd whiplashdb
    source autogen.sh

This will download, compile, and install libbson, mongoc, libbsonxx,
and mongocxx.

To build all currently integrated solvers do

    cd src/apps
    source build_apps.sh

The server should in addition be running an instance of the MongoDB
daemon which is using the database file. MongoDB can be obtained at
https://www.mongodb.org

### Deployment

Current deployment is limited to the MÃ¶nch cluster located at
monch.cscs.ch.

Future deployment types will include completely local, dockerized, and
remote clusters.

An instance of the database and the scheduler should be running on the
server. The scheduler can be started by calling
./bin/drivers/scheduler.driver

## Populating the framework

Currently all models, executables, and properties are loaded into
WhiplashDB through our CLI. All drivers for the CLI are located in the
bin/drivers directory. See below for details for the specific
requirements of each.

## Demos

A convenient way to communitate with the database is using python. A
python demo can be found in
$(whiplash_root)/src/tests/demo_python.py. The pymongo
(https://api.mongodb.org/python/current/) python module is required.

#### Loading models

Driver: commit_model.driver

Required arguments:

    -file FILENAME : the path to the model file
    -class PROBLEM_CLASS : the name of the model problem class
    -owner USER : user name of the model uploader

Optional arguments:

    -parent_id PARENT_ID : unique id of parent model
    -KEY VALUE : both key and value are specified by the user

Example:

    ./commit_model.driver -file apps/108problem.lat -class

    random configurations and returns the lowest energy found"
    -algorithm "random" -version "1.0" -build "O3" -purpose "testing"

#### Loading properties

#### Format the current instance of the database

Driver: format_db.driver

Required argument: None

Optional argument: None

Example:

    ./format_db.driver

## Querying

On the surface, querying an executable database appears similar to
querying a normal database. Here's an example in C++:

    #include "wdb.hpp"
    using wdb::odb::mongo::objectdb;
    using wdb::deployment::basic;

    int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
        // Initialize database and deployment
        objectdb db("cwave.ethz.ch:27017");
        basic deployment(db);

        // Create query object
        basic::object filter;
        basic::writer::prop("class", std::string("ising")) >> filter;

        // Query and print results
        for(const auto& result : deployment.query( filter, std::tie("cfg", "cost") ))
            std::cout << basic::reader::read<double>(*result, std::tie("cfg","cost") ) << std::endl;

        return 0;
    }

Notice we first create a filter on which to query, here all properties
with class "ising". Next we define which target we would like to
return, here "cost". Finally, we print out the results. Clearly one
does the same with a normal database.

The difference lies in the query function itself. If WhiplashDB finds
that the "cost" of any property of class "ising" is not yet computed,
it will automatically know how to compute it. It does so by using the
property's linked executable to operate on the property's linked
model.

weigtht top and soft clauses have a weight smaller than top. We assure
that top is a weight always greater than the sum of the weights of
violated soft clauses.

Example of Weighted Partial Max-SAT formula:

    c
    c comments Weighted Partial Max-SAT

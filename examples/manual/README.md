# Local deployment example

In this example we assume all work has been run outside of the Whiplash framework, but using a Whiplash compatible solver. Then all the user wants to do is commit back to Whiplash the work that was run

NOTE: For every step the Python code is very readable, so the user is encouraged to review it before use.

The only step is to run:

    ./commit_result.py input.json output.json

for each run, where input.json in the property input and output.json is the output.

# Whiplash

---

An extremely convenient and flexible high-throughput simulation
framework built by researchers for researchers.

---

__Convenient__.

Whiplash aims to abstract away the hassle of running simulations on a
cluster or in the cloud and makes it as easy as using your laptop.

__Fast__.

The core of [Whiplash](http://whiplash.ethz.ch) is written entirely by
professionals. This allows scaling to billions of simulations with
minimal overhead.

__Flexible__.

To facilitate easy of use for a variety of possible applications,
[Whiplash](http://whiplash.ethz.ch) is built around a schemaless NoSQL
database. This allows users to store arbitrary information with each
simulation.

__Simple__.

[Whiplash](http://whiplash.ethz.ch) comes packaged with a slim,
convenient interface, implemented as a Python module. Deployment is
just as easy using the [Docker](http://docker.com) container system.
